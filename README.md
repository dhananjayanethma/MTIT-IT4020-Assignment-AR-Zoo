# 🥽 Modern Topics in IT(IT4020)_Assignment_Marker-Based Augmented Reality Application(2025) - AR Zoo

---

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a **marker-based Augmented Reality (AR) mobile application** using **Unity** and the **Vuforia Engine**. The application detects predefined image markers and overlays **animated 3D models** aligned accurately with each marker.

A **Zoo environment** was selected as the project theme. Each group member contributed a unique 3D model mapped to a distinct image marker. When the AR camera detects a marker, the corresponding model appears with proper scaling, animation, and creative effects.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity** – Main development engine  
- **Vuforia Engine** – Marker-based AR tracking  
- **Unity Asset Store** – 3D models and animations  
- **Android Studio** – APK build support

## Development Process

### 1) Marker Preparation
- Designed and selected **five unique image markers** with high contrast.
- Uploaded markers to **Vuforia Target Manager**.
- Generated and imported a **device database** into Unity.

### 2) Unity Project Setup
- Created a new **Unity 3D project**.
- Activated **Vuforia Engine** via Unity Package Manager.
- Added a **Vuforia AR Camera** and configured the license key.
- Added **Image Target prefabs** and linked them with markers.

### 3) 3D Model Integration
- Imported **GLB 3D models** from the Unity Asset Store.
- Attached each model to its corresponding **Image Target**.
- Adjusted position, rotation, and scale for realistic alignment.

### 4) Creative Enhancements
- Applied **walking animations** using Animator Controller.
- Integrated **audio effects** for enhanced interaction.

### 5) Final Build & Testing
- Generated a **final Android APK**.
- Recorded a demonstration video showing marker detection, animations, and sound.
